<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Oratile Molefe, however I mainly go by Rati,
   a web developer with a passion for blending technology,
  creativity, and storytelling. With hands-on experience in the 
  Delphi programming language, I’ve developed three unique projects:
  an educational tool, a hotel booking system, and a food ordering application for hotels</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I’m inspired by the arts, pop culture,
  and brand strategy. I have a deep interest in cybersecurity 
  and IT forensics, driven by a commitment to making technology
  safer and more inclusive for all, especially for underrepresented communities.</p>

<p>I’ve been dancing since I was seven, using movement to tell stories
   and express emotions that words alone can’t capture. Whether through
  technology or dance, my mission is to give a voice to those who feel 
  unheard, creating platforms for connection and empowerment. Together,
  we can turn ideas into meaningful digital and artistic experiences.</p>
