<h1>The Best Franchises According to Rati</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Franchises of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Step Up Franchise</h3>
<p> It's STEP UP! Do I really need to explain myself? From Moose to the love story to obviously the dancing
   I mean come on it is just absolutely WOW!
</p>

<h3>Transformers Franchise</h3>
<p>I actually did not expect it to be as good as it was. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, All of them, they were 
   really amazing.
</p>

<h3>Marvel and Fast & Furious Franchise</h3>
<p>I know it is top 3 but I could not choose between Marvel and Fast and Furious. Marvel will always have a
   place in my heart but I also just discovered Fast & Furious so it is still fresh and warm in my heart. 
   This list was actually hard to make cause there are so so many beautiful movies I have watched but for now
   this is all i could come up with. Till next time!
